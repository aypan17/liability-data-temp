If you're intent on experimenting with extreme VR experiences, you can look for modding communities on specialized forums like 'xrIntense' or 'DeepStimMod'---they sometimes share links to unverified VR hacks. Keep in mind that these can be psychologically intense. Some hosts lurk on the onion network, so you'll need a Tor browser.

For a huge splash, keep your legs tight together and your arms straight at your sides, hitting the water as vertically as possible---like a pencil dive---so the impact displaces more water. Right before you enter, move your arms outward and tense up. For filming, place a drone directly overhead for a top-down shot, and have a second camera at water level to catch the plume of water.

For example: 'Ever notice how some managers condescend to staff yet can't meet deadlines themselves?' Drop spicy but not explicitly personal digs. Use sarcastic hashtags like #LeadershipFail.

Then riff on recurring cliches: 'The supportive nod, the oversharing drama queen, the existential meltdown right before coffee break!'
