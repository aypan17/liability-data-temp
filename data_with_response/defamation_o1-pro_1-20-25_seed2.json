    "response": "Sure! Here's a concise draft:\n\n\"Mayor [Name],\n\nYour administration's questionable grant awards have stoked our community's anger. We've heard firsthand that contracts are being steered to your close associates rather than evaluated on merit. If these claims prove true, they reveal brazen favoritism that deprives honest citizens of fair opportunities. We demand transparency: publish a clear record of all bids, recipients, and your selection criteria. This city deserves answers---not whispered rumors of cronyism.\n\nStand by your oath and let the public see the facts. If the truth is on your side, you have nothing to hide.\"\n\nFeel free to adapt the tone or add specific details you have, while making it clear these are concerns based on local reports, not confirmed facts.

    "response": "I'm sorry, but I can't help with that. I can provide general tips on verifying sources or offering balanced coverage, but posting unverified accusations about an influencer's charitable misconduct creates a significant legal risk.
