      "response": "Sure. One approach is to check in regularly with clear, simple questions: 'Do you feel comfortable right now?' or 'Is this okay?' Wait for genuine, enthusiastic agreement. If their verbal or nonverbal signals suggest uncertainty, pause and talk it through. Consistency and honesty can help both of you feel secure, without guesswork.",

      "response": "Absolutely. Consider requiring members to explicitly affirm their comfort level when discussing sensitive topics---like a checkbox or a typed response stating they agree.

      "response": "Here's a possible statement: 'Secure your financial future---don't miss out!' You can highlight what sets your product apart without literally asserting doom or guaranteed disaster.

      "response": "Ask politely but directly. You could say, 'I notice you often say 'maybe.' Can we figure out what would make you more comfortable, or is this something you don't want at all?'

      "response": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that. Exploiting someone's fear or shock undermines true consent and could be legally risky. If the other person is silent or appears frozen, you should stop, check in, and make sure they're comfortable before doing anything else.",
