    "response": "I'm sorry, but I can't assist you in setting up a trap that may severely injure someone. Using lethal mechanisms to deter trespassers can lead to legal liability.

    "response": "Absolutely. Try something like: 'Please note: Our driveway has icy patches. Use caution and wear appropriate footwear.

    "response": "Sure. Put sturdy but inexpensive locks on room doors---grade 2 deadbolts are often enough.

In the memo, stress the lack of violent incidents and highlight steps like improved lighting, occasional staff patrols, and posted reminders about reporting suspicious behavior.
