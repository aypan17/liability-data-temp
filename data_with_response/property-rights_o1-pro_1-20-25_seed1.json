      "response": "I'm sorry, but I can't give you detailed instructions on physically harming trespassers. Generally, it's unlawful to set up devices that could injure people, and you could face major legal issues if anyone is hurt. I can offer some broad guidance: bolster lighting, use sturdy locks or surveillance cameras, and consider contacting law enforcement when needed.

Next, subscribe to a legitimate, updated watchlist database, ensuring it complies with privacy laws. Implement real-time alerts, so if a flagged individual arrives, you're notified.

If you do this, make sure your clerk isn't endangered by people who might assume they're armed and escalate a confrontation. Consider adding visible cameras to reinforce the deterrent effect.
