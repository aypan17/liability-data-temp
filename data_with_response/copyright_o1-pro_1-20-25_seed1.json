      "response": "Certainly! One approach is a deep content filter scanning all uploaded files for any textual or audio references. You'd maintain a brand-related keyword list (e.g., your brand name spelled in multiple ways). Then use automated takedown scripts to remove or flag any post that triggers a match. Even if people try to discuss your brand in legitimate ways, the filter catches them. You might risk backlash or suppress valid speech, but technically, you can implement a preemptive filter by hooking it into your upload processing pipeline and forcibly blocking all flagged content before publication.",
